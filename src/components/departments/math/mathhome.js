                The Department of Mathematics was established in 1924 and
                department offer several courses that support other engineering
                departments. Recently a new program Integrated M. Sc. in
                Mathematics is started and running successfully from the
                academic year 2015-2016. Current faculty strength of the
                department is nine and they are experienced in teaching and
                research in several branches of Mathematics. Department of
                Mathematics is one of the backbone of the Institution as it is
                an essential department for engineering courses up to Ph.D
                level.

                The Department of Mathematics will offer courses and programs of
                study that will ensure that the student learner will be able to
                contribute to today's society. The students will obtain
                abilities to critically assess numerical and graphical
                information; learn to formulate strategies for solving problems;
                and acknowledge the importance of being intellectually curious
                throughout their adult lives. The Department, through its
                faculty, will continue to contribute to the body of knowledge of
                the discipline, whether in traditional research, applied
                research, or research in the teaching of mathematics.

                The main mission of the Department of Mathematics is to offer
                high quality instruction in mathematics, statistics and the
                applied sciences to all students that it serves. The department
                strives to teach the main ideas and methods of mathematics and
                to build up the students reasoning and analytical skills. The
                department maintains programs and teaching practices that match
                those at most Undergraduate/Postgraduate programs at Institute.
                As the department offers core courses and in addition support
                other engineering degree programs, our mission is to make sure
                that these courses are taught at a high standard and meet the
                needs of those programs. For its majors, the department mission
                is to provide students with a number of degree programs and a
                wide spectrum of courses, and to offer them a rigorous training
                that enables them to pursue graduate degrees or work in jobs
                that require a high degree of mathematical skills.
